	<p>
		This is a fun way to motivate yourself by keeping track of tasks you've done! Essentially, after
		doing a task, you add to your points, using the options provided. You can choose task "value"
		yourself. For instance, if I did the dishes, depending on how many there were and long it took -
		I could give myself 20 points! I made this as a fun evening project, so it's not highly polished
		YET! I might in the future add friend support and challenges. Have fun!
